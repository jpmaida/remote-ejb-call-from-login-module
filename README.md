# remote-ejb-call-from-login-module
Repo dedicated as proof that there is a possible bug when a EJB remote call is done inside a javax.security module.

## Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/jpmaida/remote-ejb-call-from-login-module.git
```

## Build
```
$ cd consumer/
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
$ cd provider/
$ mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

## Run
1. Copy both WAR and EAR files generated by Maven to the `deployments` directory inside your JBoss EAP 7.2 standalone mode.
2. Wait for the deploy.
3. Once is deployed, access the `http://localhost:8080/consumer/login.html` and fill the form with whatever information.
4. Login module will be executed and the NoSuchEJBException will occur.
5. Hit the `http://localhost:8080/consumer/rest/foo` REST endpoint and it will print "Hi .. I'm foo.". The same remote EJB is invoked here and works.
